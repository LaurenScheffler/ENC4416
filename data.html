        <p class="text-justify">Based on data collected from posts on July 7th, 2020 regarding Rip Jeff Bezos, one can obtain a clear understanding that this data expresses how Twitter’s algorithm played a significant role in the spread of the topic. The data collected shows factors such as frequency of posting, likes, and shares contributing to the growth of #ripjeffbezos to become trending in the eyes of Twitter. Lee Rainie and Janna Anderson explain that "the algorithms will reflect the biased thinking of people. Garbage in, garbage out. Many dimensions of life will be affected, but few will be helped." The usage of algorithms is present in the spread of the topic of Rip Jeff Bezos on social media, especially Twitter, which could explain why the hashtags and posts relating to Jeff Bezos are shared so easily. This idea can be backed by the comments on or in most of the posts across Twitter and other social platforms because many users agree with the negative opinion of Bezos. In our reading "Double-click Rhetoric" Sanchez and Villarreal mention the notion that "the spread of fake news mainly depends on an attractive, provocative, current and shocking headline, which is the content that reaches readers directly...[r]eaders share, retweet and comment without reading, let alone checking the news, hence helping the proliferation of a hoax constructed by means of a defamatory discourse" (8). These ideas about the sharing of fake news are shown through the spread of #ripjeffbezos by Twitter users; I say this because many do not like Bezos making it easy for them to blindly join the bandwagon of users believing or interacting with the fake news. Like Rainie and Anderson's statements about bias within algorithms, Michael Li also touches on the subject within our reading as well. Li mentions "[i]t's essential to keep in mind that AI is not fundamentally biased [; a]s we've seen, the bias in these algorithms are the result of biased training data built by humans." This idea of realizing that the creators of the algorithms are a part of the problem with the spread of information across social media may also have to do with the spread of information about Jeff Bezos especially #ripjeffbezos. I only say this because, on the notion of speculation, what if the creators or updaters of the algorithm did not or do not like Bezos, then allowing the spread of misinformation regarding him? Granted, since COVID, Twitter at least has been attempting to fix the spread of false information across its platform; however, the possibility is still there for bias within the platform since humans cannot be perfectly unbiased which Li, Rainie, and Anderson brought up as well.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">After looking into the spread of this fake news about Jeff Bezos across Twitter and the ongoing conversations, there is much knowledge I have absorbed surrounding this subject and viral media. I now look at viral content through a different lens by rhetorically analyzing posts I view. Based on my research and what I have learned through our readings, I now understand many factors contribute to the virality of content whether it is fake or not. Factors that influence the spread and growth of topics online include frequency of posts, who is spreading the content, follower counts, likes, shares, and more. I also understand that bias plays a role in the spread of misinformation not only from the people but the algorithms of social media platforms as well. Lastly, I learned that people’s behavior online determines the advancement of topic popularity.</p>
