      <p>Regarding the false information of Jeff Bezos dying, the original post claiming of his death is by the Twitter user @INUM4KIS on July 7th, 2020 stating, “homie got lost in the amazon ￿￿￿ #ripjeffbezos.” @INUM4KIS’s comment is followed by images of the Avatar The Last Airbender character ‘Aang’ who is bald similar to Bezos. This Twitter user has not been deemed an influencer with a verification checkmark on their account; however, they have 2,826 followers and received 548 likes along with 53 retweets on the initial #ripjeffbezos tweet. After reviewing all the tweets from July 7th, 2020, the initial intent of this trending false claim can be identified as a joke that was decided over a group chat. The group chat behind this trending topic is comprised of an online community of anime connoisseurs specifically interested in Avatar The Last Airbender. This can be confirmed by tweets using the hashtag #ripjeffbezos such as @cultypattinson’s tweet on July 7th, 2020 stating, “Not white lotus thirst gc mourning his death #ripjeffbezos”. @cultypattinson’s post includes two screenshots from the group chat showing the evidence of the agenda behind the hashtag. This post revealed that the main purpose of #ripjeffbezos was to simply make it become a trending topic.</p>

      <br>

      <p>This trending topic came to light right after Amazon’s stock reached a new record, most likely due to the COVID-19 national quarantine occurring at the time. In response to the trending topic, some social media users were confused as the topic was on the rise. Many users on Twitter, however, spread #ripjeffbezos with images of people or characters that look like him or are bald and sentiments of seemingly kind remorse. The confused messages questioning the CEO’s death did not gain much traction while those mocking his death with false imagery had thousands of likes and retweets. Following the initial post sparking this topic, one may assume that these subsequent rhetors were piggybacking off the joke already started. The only twist the Twitter atmosphere added to posts on the trending topic was the usage of images and videos that were not Jeff Bezos. Many of these images and videos were not even relating to Bezos which became the joke rather than the text itself. These behaviors, exhibited through social media posts, are similar to that of what Erika Sparby mentions in our reading "Digital Social Media." Sparby states, "memes act as cultural units that spread any idea from person to person...[t]hey influence behavior, not only on an individual level but also on a group, or collective, level" (p.86). Memes mentioned by Sparby relate to the actions of those who posted about Jeff Bezos because in a way each post is a response to one another, and the posts mimic each other by the similarity of their layouts. </p>

      <br>

      <p>When the topic first began, the anime community, who was a part of the group chat who birthed the idea of this trend, took part by posting tweets incorporating the hashtag while mainly posting media content from Avatar The Last Airbender. Due to a large amount of posting by this ingular community, which has many people within it fixating on the topic #ripjeffbezos, this activity and a large number of likes on posts helped spread the topic. With these factors in mind and persistent posting, the hashtag started to gain an audience rather quickly leading it to become a trending topic within 20 minutes holding that title into the next day. The negative opinions people hold for Bezos and the combination of his supposed death was a major appeal to the target audience of this trend. Many poked fun at Jeff Bezos, memorializing him with inaccurate images and videos helping spread this misinformation. </p>
